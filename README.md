## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE online_voting_system;
```

2. Import the database schema:
```bash
mysql -u username -p online_voting_system < database.sql
```

3. Update database configuration in `config/database.php`:
```php
private $host = 'localhost';
private $db_name = 'online_voting_system';
private $username = 'your_username';
private $password = 'your_password';
```

### 2. File Uploads

Create the uploads directory and set permissions:
```bash
mkdir -p uploads/voter_cards
chmod 755 uploads/voter_cards
```

### 3. Web Server Configuration

Ensure your web server is configured to:
- Execute PHP files
- Handle file uploads (check `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in php.ini)
- Support sessions

### 4. Access the System

- **Main Page**: `http://yourdomain.com/index.php`
- **Admin Panel**: Login with admin credentials from the database

## üîê Default Admin Credentials

The system comes with a default admin account:
- **Admin ID**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password` (hashed in database)

**Important**: Change the default password after first login!

- **Regular Updates**: Keep PHP and dependencies updated
- **Backup**: Regular database and file backups

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check database credentials in `config/database.php`
   - Ensure MySQL service is running
   - Verify database exists

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check `uploads/` directory permissions
   - Verify PHP upload settings in `php.ini`
   - Check file size limits

3. **Session Issues**
   - Ensure sessions are enabled in PHP
   - Check session directory permissions
   - Verify session configuration

### Debug Mode
